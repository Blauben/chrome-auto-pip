# Chrome Automatic Picture-in-Picture (PiP)

Automatically enables Picture-in-Picture when switching tabs like Arc or Firefox or Zen.

Also works with Brave Browser (and I assume other Chromium based browsers, though I have not tested those).

Includes one click activation of Picture-in-Picture through plugin icon.

## Installation

1. **Install the extension** 
- (Link to Chrome Store coming soon)

2. **Enable the browser flag**
- Go to `about://flags` in your browser
- Search for "Auto picture in picture for video playback"
- Set it to **Enabled**
- Restart your browser

## Usage

**Automatic:** Switch tabs away from a video and it will automatically enter PiP mode

**Manual:** Click the extension icon to immediately activate PiP on the current video

## Requirements

- Chrome 134+ or compatible Chromium browser
- `auto-picture-in-picture-for-video-playback` browser flag enabled, see instructions above
