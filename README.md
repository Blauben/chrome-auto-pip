# Chrome Automatic Picture-in-Picture (PiP)

Automatically enables Picture-in-Picture when switching tabs like Arc or Firefox or Zen.

Also works with Brave Browser (and I assume other Chromium based browsers, though I have not tested those).

Includes one click activation of Picture-in-Picture through plugin icon.

## Installation

1. **Enable the browser flag (REQUIRED)**

   Go to `about://flags` and search for `auto-picture-in-picture-for-video-playback`
   
   Set the flag to **Enabled**
   
   Restart your browser

2. **Install the extension** 

   (Link to Chrome Store coming soon)

## Usage

**Automatic:** Switch tabs away from a video and it will automatically enter PiP

**Manual:** Click the extension icon to immediately activate PiP on the current video

## Requirements

- Chrome 134+ or compatible Chromium browser
